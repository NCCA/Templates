#Template programming code
Ok this is an experiment in generating the readme from my lecture notes to see if it works ok. The slides are below.

##Introduction
*“Code-generating programs are sometimes called metaprograms; writing such programs is called metaprogramming”.

*There are many different forms of meta programs depending upon the language being used.

*In General this can be approached either by having a program generate new code at runtime

*Or by using some form of pre-processor.

##Macros in C/C++
*The C/C++ pre-processor is responsible for macro expansion.
*This happens before the code is compiled
*Usually we limit the use of Macros to the C programming language, and try to use them sparingly
*In C++ we will avoid and use templates
